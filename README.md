# Transliteration From English To Hindi Using Seq2Seq model 
 The objective of the work to predict the transliteration of hindi data towards english. Use the seq2seq model to transliterate the hindi text. Download the data from [here](https://github.com/anoopkunchukuttan/crowd-indic-transliteration-data). The encoder decoder are two major components used in the seq2seq models. Here keras library is mainly used. The encoder layer is biult by using embedding layer followed by LSTM and the decode layer is build by LSTM followed by Dense layer.
